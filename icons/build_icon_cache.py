"""
Purpose:
This script is designed to create sparse copies of theme directories based on the structure specified in a YAML file.
It aims to extract only the essential files as defined in the YAML file and replicate the directory structure in the
current working directory. Additionally, the script generates a Qt resource file (theme_icons.qrc), which lists all
the copied files, making it convenient for use in Qt applications.

This only works on Linux systems that have Qt theme icons installed.

The YAML file must include two sections:
1. Theme directories: A list of the absolute paths to the theme directories.
2. Files: A dictionary that represents the structure of the files to be copied.
   It should contain the category, subcategory, and a list of filenames.
   

Example:
```
Theme directories:
    - /usr/share/icons/breeze
    - /usr/share/icons/breeze-dark
Files:
    actions:
        16:
            - document-new.svg
            - document-open.svg
            - document-save.svg
    
    apps:
        16:
            - kcalc.svg
            - kcharselect.svg
    
    mimetypes:
        16:
            - text-plain.svg
            - text-x-generic.svg
```


The script performs the following tasks:
1. Parse the YAML file to obtain the theme directory paths and file structure.
2. Create sparse copies of the theme directories, copying only the specified files.
3. Generate the theme_icons.qrc file, listing all the copied files with their relative paths.

Usage:
- Make sure the YAML file with the desired structure is in the current working directory and named "theme_list.yaml".
- Run the script, being aware of your current working directory, as that is where the file will go.

Requirements:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyYAML library
