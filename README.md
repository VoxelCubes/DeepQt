- Support for text files (epub coming eventually)

## Requires

- A DeepL API license, either free or pro. [How do I get this?](https://github.com/VoxelCubes/DeepQt/blob/master/docs/api_help.md)

- A Python installation, version **3.10** or higher. On Linux you will probably already have this installed. On Windows, you will likely need to set it up. [Download Python | Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use your package manager (apt, pacman, dnf, chocolatey, winget etc.)
